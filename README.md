### :v: Yo, my name is Sergey
I graduated from **RTU** (Russian Techonological University) as Software Engineer and right now 2nd year masters student at **Skoltech** as Data Scientist. I research generative AI models, mostly diffusion models and their extensions to editing and control, as well as adaptation of RL to diffusion models.
